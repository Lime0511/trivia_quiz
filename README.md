# Trivia Quiz Project

# Project Description:
This is a simple trivia quiz web application developed in three iterations. The quiz allows users to answer multiple-choice questions, see their scores, and view a leaderboard. The project demonstrates progressive development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with enhanced features added in each iteration.

Branching and Merging Strategy
For each iteration, a separate branch (iteration-1, iteration-2, iteration-3) was created to isolate development.

Features were developed and tested within their respective branches.

After completing each iteration, the branch was merged into the main branch to keep the main codebase stable and up-to-date.

Tags (v1.0, v2.0, v3.0) were created after merging each iteration to mark stable release points.

This strategy allowed organized, incremental development and easy tracking of progress.

How This Workflow Helped
Using branches for each iteration prevented conflicts and allowed focused development on features.

Merging ensured that the main branch always contained the latest stable code.

Tagging provided clear milestones for each version, simplifying version control and review.

The workflow supported clear documentation of progress and made collaboration easier.

How to Run the Quiz
Clone the repository or download the source code.

Open SourceCode/Iteration3/index.html (or any iteration folder) in a modern web browser.

For the full experience, use Iteration 3 with audio and leaderboard features.

Enjoy the quiz!
