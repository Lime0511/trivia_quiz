# Trivia Quiz Project

## Project Description:
- This is a simple trivia quiz web application developed in three iterations. The quiz allows users to answer multiple-choice questions, see their scores, and view a leaderboard. The project demonstrates progressive development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with enhanced features added in each iteration.

## Branching and Merging Strategy:
- For each iteration, a separate branch (`iteration-1`, `iteration-2`, `iteration-3`) was created to isolate development.
- Features were developed and tested within their respective branches.
- This strategy allowed organised, incremental development and easy tracking of progress.

## Kanban Board for Task Management
- We used ClickUp to manage our project tasks using a Kanban board. The board included columns for Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Testing, and Done. Each iteration was broken down into small, actionable tasks, and each task was tracked as a card on the board.
- As we progressed, tasks were moved across columns to reflect their status. This helped us visualise our workflow, prioritise tasks, and identify any bottlenecks early. The Kanban board also made it easier to collaborate and ensure nothing was overlooked.
